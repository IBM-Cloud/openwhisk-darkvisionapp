 * A vertical direction will constrain the layout by rows (lineItemCount per row), a horizontal direction by columns (lineItemCount per column).

/**
 * Defines the size of the unconstrained dimension of the items. Simply, for vertical layouts this is the height of the items, and for horizontal layouts this is the width of the items.
 * Setting this value to 0 will make layout set the dimension to the average of the other dimenion on the same line. This is due to the layout taking account of dirty pixels, adding these extra pixels in the first X items on the line.
 * For example, if using a vertical scrollDirection and a lineItemCount of 5 when the collectionView has a width of 104, the first 4 items on every line will have a width of 21, and the last 20 (21 + 21 + 21 + 21 + 20 = 104), so the height of the lines would be 21 (20.8 rounded).
 *
 * A value of 0 is the same as setting the `lineExtension` property to 0 `lineMultiplier` property to 1. Setting this value will ignore the `lineExtension` and `lineMultiplier` properties and set them to their default values. When used and set in Interface Builder, leave the other properties to Default and only set this property.
 *
 * The default value of this property is 0.

The final dimension is rounded to a whole integer.
